This is my final project for the Program of the Environment Morocco study abroad course. I chose to make a creative project in the form of a data visualization app. This project provides an overview of the agricultural water usage of the top 6 agriculturally-reliant countries in the MENA region. 

The MENA region (Middle East/North Africa) encompasses the historical Fertile Crescent, often considered as the cradle of agriculture. Early farmers developed various techniques to manage their water resources (Crabben). With the rising temperatures and frequent droughts of modern climate change, concerns over water conservation have intensified.

Among the nations in the MENA region, the Syrian Arab Republic, Algeria, Yemen, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia have the greatest reliance on agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors as a percentage of their GDP (World Bank). These six countries are indicators of whether modern farming practices are creating a sustainable agricultural economy. The following graphs are based on data sourced from AQUASTAT, a comprehensive global dataset created by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. (https://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-and-software/aquastat/en/)

Despite low scores in water efficiency measures, Morocco displays steady improvement over time. Morocco also has the lowest levels of agricultural water withdrawal and water stress among the six main agricultural countries. These outcomes place Morocco as a leader in agricultural water conservation in the MENA region.
