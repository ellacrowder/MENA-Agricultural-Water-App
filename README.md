This is my final project for my Program of the Environment Morocco study abroad course. This is my final project for my Program of the Environment Morocco study abroad course. I chose to make a creative project in the form of a data visualization app. This project provides an overview of the agricultural water usage of the top 6 agriculturally-reliant countries in the MENA region. Using the AQUASTAT Dissemination Systems dataset, we can compare Morocco's efforts towards water conservation with similar countries.
